Apache DeltaSpike-0.5 Release Notes


The following modules and big features got added in the DeltaSpike-0.5 release:

* DeltaSpike-Data

The DeltaSpike Data module enhances JPA experience with declarative
queries, reducing boilerplate to a minimum. DeltaSpike Data repositories
can derive queries by simple method names, or by method annotations
defining JPQL, named queries or even plain SQL - beside result pagination
and sorting. The module also features auditing of entities and a simplified
alternative to the Criteria API.


* DeltaSpike-Servlet

The DeltaSpike Servlet module provides integration with the Java Servlet
API. It adds support for injection of common servlet objects
and propagates servlet events to the CDI event bus.


* DeltaSpike-BeanValidation

The main feature of the Bean Validation module is to provide
CDI integration in to ConstraintValidators. This allows you to
inject CDI objects, EJBs etc in to your validators.
