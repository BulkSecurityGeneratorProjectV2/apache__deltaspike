== Verifying Releases


It is essential that you verify the integrity of any downloaded files
using the PGP or MD5 signatures. For more information on signing
artifacts and why we do it, check out the
http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[Release Signing FAQ].

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
http://www.apache.org/dist/deltaspike/KEYS[KEYS] as well as the asc
signature file for the artifact. Make sure you get these files from the
http://www.apache.org/dist/deltaspike/[main distribution directory],
rather than from a
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/deltaspike/[mirror]. Then verify
the signatures using e.g.:

------------------------------------------------------
$ pgpk -a KEYS
$ pgpv deltaspike-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
------------------------------------------------------

or

-----------------------------------------------------
$ pgp -ka KEYS
$ pgp deltaspike-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
-----------------------------------------------------

or

--------------------------------------------------------------
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --verify deltaspike-project-1.2.0-source-release.zip.asc
--------------------------------------------------------------
